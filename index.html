        <p>Suits is a USA Network drama created by Aaron Korsh that stars Patrick J. Adams as Michael "Mike" Ross and Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The series is set at Pearson Hardman, a fictitious law firm in New York City. Mike, once a college scholarship recipient and on his way to becoming a law student at Harvard University, was kicked out of college for selling the answers to a math test he had memorized, ruining his chances of attending law school. Mike instead makes a living as a bicycle messenger, and is convinced by his friend, Trevor, to take part in a marijuana deal. </p>
        
        <p>The deal happens to be a sting operation which Mike astutely discovers and narrowly avoids, instead stumbling into a job interview with Harvey, a lawyer at Pearson Hardman and arguably the "best closer in New York City". Having recently made senior partner, Harvey must now hire a Harvard-educated lawyer as an associate, as per firm policy. Using his eidetic memory and knowledge of the law, Mike proves to Harvey that he is undoubtedly the best candidate for the position and is subsequently hired, despite neither having a college degree nor attending Harvard. The series focuses on Mike and Harvey as they try cases for the firm while maintaining Mike's secret.</p>
